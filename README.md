## 📚 What’s Covered

### **Part 1: IPv4 Subnetting Fundamentals**
- Numbering systems: Decimal vs. Binary
- IPv4 address structure (32 bits, 4 octets)
- The Octet Chart: converting binary ↔ decimal
- Step-by-step conversion (e.g., 178 → `10110010`)
- CIDR notation (/24, /26, /28, etc.)
- Subnet breakdown: `192.168.1.0/24` → four `/26` subnets
- Practice quiz: “Can You Convert These?”

### **Part 2: Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM)**
- Why VLSM? Efficient IP allocation for real-world needs
- VLSM design rules (sort largest first, align to boundaries)
- Interactive VLSM planner
- Student practice sandbox: enter any network + host requirements → get a full subnet plan or clear error feedback
